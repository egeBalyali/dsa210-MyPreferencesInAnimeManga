# dsa210-MyPreferencesInAnimeManga
I read a lot of manga, and have watched numerous animes. But when I search for a new one it is always a toss-up. So in this project I will first parse My Anime List with its APİ. This site is where I record my reading list as well as my points.
I will first explore this data and create some graphs. And then I plan on creating a machine learning model to guess if I will like it.
The important attributes that I will need: {"chapter count", "how many chapters ı read", "is it finished","average score", "genres", "tags", "when was it published"}
